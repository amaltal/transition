The kidnapping of the Chibok girls in 2014 by Boko Haram in Nigeria remains one of the most globally recognized examples of mass hostage-taking, not only for its scale but for the profound emotional and psychological toll it inflicted. For the girls, captivity was marked by the collapse of personal agency, as their identities and choices were forcibly erased by their captors. The experience of being a hostage — sudden disconnection from familiar life, uncertainty about survival, and the struggle to retain a sense of self amid relentless control — mirrors the psychological landscape faced by countless others who have endured forced captivity. The Chibok girls' ordeal highlights how hostages often live suspended between worlds: belonging nowhere, unable to return unchanged to the life they left behind, and burdened with the complexity of reintegration into societies that may not fully grasp the invisible wounds captivity leaves behind.

In May 1985, David P. Jacobsen, an American hospital administrator in Beirut, was kidnapped by Hezbollah-linked militants and held captive for 17 months. His experience as a hostage was marked by isolation, physical deprivation, and psychological pressure. Confined in small, often filthy rooms, sometimes blindfolded and shackled, Jacobsen faced constant uncertainty about his fate. He described struggling with feelings of helplessness, anger, and despair, yet also enduring through small routines and personal resolve. His captors provided minimal human interaction and fluctuated between harshness and calculated propaganda efforts. Jacobsen’s reflections reveal how hostage-taking aims to strip individuals of autonomy, but also how internal resilience and the hope of reunion with loved ones become critical to survival. His story underscores the deep psychological scars captivity can inflict, even after freedom is regained.
