  description: Through reasearching the effects of being kidnapped and held hostage there were six words that stood out encapsulating much of the traumatic experience. Those words are Helplessness, Autonomy, Belong, Power, Guilt, and Isolation. These words and the diagrams they inspired share so many characteristics including an element of time. The temporal scale has been important in the creation of this project.
